# Spring AI Tools Agent Demo
When you defined a remote MCP server, if it shuts down, the MCP client cannot retry to connect to the remote server. This demo shows how to do pure method agent without MCP.

To reduce the dependency of a remote server, if you need extra computing resources, you can define API, then these tools can call the API to fulfill your tooling requirements.
